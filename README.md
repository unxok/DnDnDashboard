# DnDnDashboard

## What is this for?

The idea with this project started from me using Roll20 to play Dungeons and Dragons with some friends. The character sheet interface on there is not that bad, however I found myself wanting to have a whole _workspace_ where I could take notes during a campaign, as well as quickly see my stats and update them as needed.

## High Level Roadmap

- Learn how to use ~~`react-beautiful-dnd`~~ ~~`react-grid-layout`~~ `react-dnd-kit` to make draggable and droppable components
- Make custom components
  - `#Future` Maybe make it so the player can customize their own components?
- Make front end pretty
- Database :
  - Go SQL Lite so I can ship it all as an Electron app?
  - Need to think of way to share data between devices
  - Could have everything work off of one DB that I host?

## Wait, is someone other than me reading this?

Hey there! I am very much a beginner in React and I am not looking for suggestions, critiques, or collaborators at this time. Please feel free to take a look around though!
